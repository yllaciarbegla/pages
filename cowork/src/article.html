							<p class="article__text text">
								When you can't meet face-to-face, video conferencing is the next best thing. Zoom has emerged as one of the most popular and user-friendly options. In addition to HD video calls, it offers screen sharing, recording capabilities, and integrations with other apps. Use it for virtual meetings, team check-ins, or even virtual co-working sessions.

							<img class="article__image" src="img/article/2.jpg" height="240" alt="Abstraction">
							<p class="article__text text">
								For streamlining project management, Trello is a simple and visual tool. Its card-based kanban boards allow you to create task lists, assign items to team members, set due dates, attach files, and more. The ability to easily see each project's status and quickly drag-and-drop tasks makes it ideal for remote teams.

						<div class="article__group">
							<h3 class="h3">File Storage & Collaboration: Google Drive</h3>
							<img class="article__image" src="img/article/3.jpg" height="240" alt="Books">
							<p class="article__text text">
								Having a centralized place to store and collaborate on documents, spreadsheets, and other files is vital when working remotely. Google Drive provides cloud storage and its suite of productivity apps integrates real-time co-editing so multiple team members can work on the same file simultaneously.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="article__group">
							<h3 class="h3">Team Communication: Slack</h3>
							<p class="article__text text">
								Efficient team communication is crucial for remote teams, which makes Slack one of the most valuable collaboration tools. This messaging app allows you to organize conversations into dedicated channels, share files, leverage integrations with other apps, and quickly get in touch whether it's for group discussions or one-on-one chats.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="article__group">
							<h3 class="h3">Work Management: Asana</h3>
							<p class="article__text text">
								Projects can easily get derailed when teams aren't properly aligned on responsibilities, deadlines, and milestones. Asana is a work management platform designed to solve this issue. You can create projects and tasks, assign owners, set due dates, add attachments, and see projects through multiple views like timeline, calendar, or kanban boards.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="article__group">
							<h3 class="h3">Video Messaging: Loom</h3>
							<p class="article__text text">
								Sometimes explaining things over video is much easier than trying to put it into words. Loom is a video messaging tool that lets you record your screen, voice, and face. Use it to create quick tutorials, give feedback on designs, explain complex tasks, or just more personally connect with remote colleagues.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="article__group">
							<h3 class="h3">Audio Enhancement: Krisp</h3>
							<p class="article__text text">
								For remote workers without a professional recording setup, background noise can be an issue on video calls. Krisp is an AI-powered app that silences ambient sound and clears up audio so you always sound professional. It even has a mode to remove noise from pre-recorded audio files.
							</p>
						</div>
						<p class="article__text text">
							The right collaboration tools help remote teams work as a synced unit rather than just scattered individuals. Implement a virtual toolbox like the options listed above and you'll go a long way towards driving productivity and effective teamwork for your remote or distributed workforce.
